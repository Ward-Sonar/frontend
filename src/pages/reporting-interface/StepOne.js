                  We know that sometimes on wards patients donâ€™t feel safe. We are trying to make wards safer by understanding how the feeling of a ward (atmosphere/milieu) links to patient safety. We want to see if we can learn about how wards feel and help staff to make them feel safer.

                  Over the next few weeks we will ask you three questions, three times a day. The questions have been written with patients. They try to focus on how the ward (atmosphere/milieu) feels to you.

                  We very much hope that you will help us, it should take no more than a few minutes of your time. The more times you do this the better it will be for the study, but if now is not a good time just click the button [Not right now] below.
